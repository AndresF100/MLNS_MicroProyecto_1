# Color Palette Generator from Images

## Project Overview
This project uses unsupervised machine learning to create color palettes from images. It is designed to process high-resolution artistic images and generate a representative color scheme using clustering algorithms.

## Repository Structure
- `Data`: Contains the datasets and images used for model training and testing.
- `Output`: Stores the output palettes and any other results generated by the scripts.
- `Microproyecto1.pdf`: The project rubric outlining objectives and evaluation criteria.
- `Modelado Final.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook with the final model implementation.

## Getting Started
To use this code, clone the repository, install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, and run `Modelado Final.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`

## Usage
- Use `Modelado Final.ipynb` to generate color palettes from a new set of images by placing them in the `Data` directory.
- For custom palette sizes, adjust the `n_clusters` parameter within the K-Means algorithm.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your features or fixes.


## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to all the contributors who have helped with code, tests, and ideas.
